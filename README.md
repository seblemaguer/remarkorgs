# remarkorgs

This project is a wrapper around [remarks](https://github.com/Scrybbling-together/remarks).
remarks is aimed to be integrated to the scrybble pipeline but yet contains a lot of things that I need.
Therefore, the goal of this wrapper is to process what I want, while keeping maximumal dependency to remarks but without impacting its core.
